PROJECT SUMMARY

The objective is to address the following key business questions posed by the client:

•	Which products generate the highest revenue and profit, and what are their associated costs?

•	What are the trends in financial metrics such as revenue, cost, and profit over time?

•	How do order statuses (completed, pending, returned) evolve, and what patterns can we identify?

The project delivers a fully automated, dynamic Excel dashboard that integrates data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization. It is designed as a self-sufficient tool, requiring no further intervention from data professionals. Clients can immediately begin using the dashboard to make informed data-driven decisions effortlessly.

DATA CLEANING
1.	Standardizing Formats: Ensure uniform date, time, and numeric formats for consistency.
2.	Validating Data: Apply checks for errors, such as valid emails and proper spelling.
3.	Removing Duplicates: Eliminate duplicate entries to maintain data integrity.
4.	Handling Missing Values: Fill gaps using imputation, interpolation, or appropriate removal.

  	 DATA PROCESSING
1.	Merging Tables: Combine datasets using keys to create a unified view of the data.
2.	Creating Calculated Columns: Add new columns derived from formulas and logical operations.
3.	Applying VLOOKUP: Link related data across tables to enrich the dataset with relevant information.
4.	Filtering and Sorting: Organize data to focus on relevant subsets and insights.

   
DATA ANALYSIS
1.	Descriptive Statistics:
o	Perform a comprehensive statistical summary to uncover key patterns and trends in the dataset.
o	Identify outliers and distributional properties to ensure data consistency and reliability before further analysis.
2.	Hypothesis Testing Using t-Test: Conduct a two-sample t-test to evaluate the statistical significance of differences between two groups or conditions based on the client's business question.

DASHBOARD
1.	Create KPI in Pivot Table: Design the pivot table to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs).
2.	Design Framework: Plan the layout and structure of the dashboard on paper, then replicate it in Excel.
3.	Create Charts: Add the necessary charts to visualize the KPIs and data insights.
4.	Add Slicers: Insert slicers for interactive filtering of data within the dashboard.
5.	Final Check: Review the dashboard for accuracy and functionality.
